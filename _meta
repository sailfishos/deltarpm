  <title>Create deltas between rpms</title>
  <description>A deltarpm contains the difference between an old
and a new version of a rpm, which makes it possible
to recreate the new rpm from the deltarpm and the old
one. You don't have to have a copy of the old rpm,
deltarpms can also work with installed rpms.
